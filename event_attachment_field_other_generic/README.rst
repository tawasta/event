Event: Attachment Field for Generic Event File
==============================================

* The attachment is automatically made public and given an URL,
  enabling to link to it in e.g. event e-mail templates

Configuration
=============
* You probably want to install also 'event_mail_freetext_field'
  for a convenient place to embed the attachment link, and 
  make an e-mail template that utilizes that module's fields  

Usage
=====
* Open event form view to see the new attachment field.
* After adding an attachment, you can copy/paste its 
  public URL to clipboard
