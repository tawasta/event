Event Ticket Registration: Self or Invite Others
================================================

This module enhances Odoo's event registration system by allowing users to either register themselves for an event or invite others to join the event. It integrates with the existing shopping cart system and enables participants to manage invitations, track their status, and allow recipients to accept invitations through a secure link.
